== About Me

I'm a fourth-year PhD student in the [https://www.essie.ufl.edu/civil-coastal-engineering Department of Civil and Coastal Engineering], [http://www.ufl.edu/ University of Florida], majoring in Transportation Engineering (Please find my lab [https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/sermos-lab here]). I also hold a Ph.D. Minor in Applied Statistics. I received my bachelor degree in Transportation Engineering from [https://en.swjtu.edu.cn/ Southwest Jiao Tong University], Chengdu, China, where I was advised by [https://faculty.swjtu.edu.cn/yanghongtai/en/index.htm Prof. Hongtai Yang]. Before joining UF, I was a visiting research assistant at [https://shanghai.nyu.edu/ New York University Shanghai], Shanghai, China from 2020 to 2021, where I was advised by [https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/zhibin-chen Prof. Zhibin Chen].

My research mainly focuses on (1) developing Responsible AI solutions to advance travel behavior decision-support systems and evacuation behavior analysis under natural hazards; (2) using large-scale mobile phone location data to understand the resilience of human mobility in the face of weather and climate diasters.
